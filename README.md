# Obstacle avoiding robot (Vehicle Chassis) using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors.

## *What is this?*

# Abstract: 
This project describes about an obstacle avoidance robot vehicle which is controlled by ultrasonic sensor. The robot is made using ultrasonic sensor and it is controlled by Arduino microcontroller. Ultrasonic sensor fixed in front portion of the robot vehicle. The sensor gets the data from surrounding area through mounted sensors on the robot. The sensor is sense the obstacle and deviate its path to choose an obstacle free path. The sensor will be send the data to the controller is compared with controller to decide the movement of the robot Wheel. The robot wheel movement and direction will be based on the sensing of the ultrasonic sensor and also using a wheel encoder. This vehicle is used for detecting obstacle and avoiding the collision. We have programmed the controller to be used with ANDROID app.

APPLICATION:

1. Obstacle avoiding robots can be used in almost all mobile robot navigation systems. 

2. They can be used for household work like automatic vacuum cleaning. 

3. They can also be used in dangerous environments, where human penetration could be fatal.
